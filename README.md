## Notes: Branch, Condition, Jump to the Last Routine <br>
#### Branch<br>
With loop function, different routines will be presented depending on the participants' answer to the previous routine.<br>
Please check the 'Code' element in each routines.<br>
#### Condition<br>
(1) With xlsx file, you can present the stimulus in randomized order. The xlsx file should be uploaded in the 'stimuliloop' window (Conditions section).<br>
(2) Stimulus are presented in random order (loopType = 'random').<br>
#### Jump to the Last Routine<br>
Codes were added to skip 'consent' and/or 'stimuli' routine and directly go to the last ('bye') routine.<br>
